## Research Guidelines
- Build small prototypes to test assumptions
- Document integration patterns as they're discovered
- Update type definitions based on practical usage
- Test cross-package interactions early
- Validate assumptions with real usage scenarios

## Development Notes
- Phases may overlap as we learn more
- Early phases focus on learning and prototyping
- Type definitions will evolve with understanding
- Storage schema should follow proven patterns
- UI can start early with mock data
