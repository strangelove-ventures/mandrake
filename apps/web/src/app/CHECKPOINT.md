# First Implementation Checkpoint

## What's Implemented

1. **Core Structure**
   - Proper server/client code separation
   - Layout components with app shell
   - Next.js configuration to handle server-side modules
   - Mock implementations for client-side

2. **Dashboard & Navigation**
   - Main dashboard with navigation
   - Sidebar with proper navigation links
   - Theme switching (light/dark/system)

3. **Workspaces Management**
   - Workspaces listing page
   - Workspace creation form
   - Basic workspace detail page with tabs
   - API routes with mock data

4. **State Management**
   - UI store for theme and sidebar
   - Workspaces store for workspace management
   - API client functions for data fetching

## Next Steps

1. **Sessions Management**
   - Session listing component
   - Session creation form
   - Chat interface with message history
   - Streaming implementation

2. **Models & Tools Configuration**
   - Models configuration interface
   - Tools management interface
   - Active selection and configuration 

3. **Dynamic Context & Files**
   - Dynamic context management
   - File explorer and editor
   - File upload functionality

4. **API Routes**
   - Complete the implementation of remaining API routes using factories
   - Connect to the backend services properly
   - Handle error cases comprehensively

5. **Polish & Refinement**
   - Add loading states and skeletons
   - Improve error handling
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Implement proper animations

## Development Guidelines

1. Always separate server and client code:
   - Server components for data fetching
   - Client components for UI interactions
   - Clear boundaries with 'use client' directives

2. Use stores for state management:
   - Create separate stores for different domains
   - Keep UI state separate from data state
   - Use React Query for advanced data fetching if needed

3. API implementation:
   - Use the factory pattern consistently
   - Handle error cases properly
   - Consider implementing data validation

4. Testing:
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Consider adding integration tests for key flows
