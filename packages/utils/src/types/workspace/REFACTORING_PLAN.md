# Workspace Package Type Refactoring Plan - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

This plan focused on extracting and reorganizing the types from the workspace package into the utils package. The workspace package contained several key type definitions that are used across multiple packages and needed to be made available as shared types.

## Types Extracted

We have successfully extracted the following types:

### ✅ Core Workspace Types
- Workspace definitions (`Workspace`, `workspaceSchema`)
- Workspace configuration
- Workspace management interfaces

### ✅ Files
- File system types (`FileInfo`, `fileInfoSchema`)
- File structure representations
- File operation interfaces

### ✅ Tools
- Tool definitions
- Tool configuration (`ServerConfig`, `ToolConfig`, `ToolsConfig`)
- Tool execution interfaces

### ✅ Dynamic Context
- Dynamic context rules
- Context evaluation
- Context refresh interfaces (`DynamicContextMethodConfig`, `ContextConfig`)

### ✅ Prompt
- Prompt sections
- Prompt configuration (`PromptConfig`, `promptConfigSchema`)
- Prompt building interfaces

### ✅ Configuration Types
- `MandrakeConfig`
- `RegisteredWorkspace`
- Configuration schemas

### ✅ Database Entity Types
- Session entities (`SessionEntity`, `RequestEntity`, `ResponseEntity`)
- Round entities (`RoundEntity`, `RoundWithDataEntity`)
- Turn entities (`TurnEntity`, `TurnWithToolCallsEntity`)
- Tool call types (`ToolCall`)

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Core Workspace Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/workspace/workspace.ts`

### 2. Files Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/workspace/files.ts`

### 3. Tools Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/workspace/tools.ts`

### 4. Dynamic Context Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/workspace/dynamic.ts`

### 5. Prompt Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/workspace/prompt.ts`

### 6. Configuration Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/workspace/config.ts`

### 7. Database Entity Types

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/session/entities.ts`

## Database Schema Approach

For database schema types, we:

1. Created clean entity interfaces in `packages/utils/src/types/session/entities.ts`
2. Implemented mapper functions in `packages/workspace/src/session/mappers.ts` to convert between DB types and entity types
3. Updated the SessionManager to use these entity types in its public API
4. Added documentation on how to update the types when the database schema changes

## Testing Completed

All tests are now passing with the refactored types:

1. Updated exports in the utils package
2. Updated imports in the workspace package to use the new types
3. Added conversion logic where needed
4. Verified builds and tests pass in both packages

## Conclusion

The workspace package type refactoring is now complete. We've successfully established a clean boundary between DB implementation details and the entity types used throughout the application. The next step is to continue with the MCP package types.
