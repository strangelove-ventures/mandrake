# MCP Package Type Refactoring Plan (COMPLETED)

## Overview

This plan focused on extracting and reorganizing the types from the MCP (Model Context Protocol) package into the utils package. The MCP package contains server management, transport protocol, and tool types that should be made available as shared types.

## Types Extracted

Based on the review of the MCP package, we extracted the following types:

### Server Types ✅
- Server configuration (renamed `MCPServerConfig` to avoid conflict)
- Server state tracking (`ServerState`)
- Server interface (`MCPServer`)

### Transport Types ✅
- Connection interface (`MCPConnection`)
- Transport types (`TransportType` enum)
- Transport options (`TransportOptions`)

### Tool Types ✅
- Tool definitions with server info (renamed `MCPToolWithServer` to avoid conflict)
- Tool with server ID (`ToolWithServerIdentifier`)
- Tool invocation response (`ToolInvocationResponse`)
- Tool arguments (`ToolArguments`)

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Server Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/mcp/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/mcp/src/server.ts`

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/mcp/server.ts`

### 2. Transport Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/mcp/src/transport/index.ts`
- `packages/mcp/src/types/index.ts`

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/mcp/transport.ts`

### 3. Tool Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/mcp/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/mcp/src/manager.ts`

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/mcp/tools.ts`

## Integration Results

The refactoring was completed with the following outcomes:

1. All MCP types are now defined in the utils package
2. The MCP package imports types from utils and re-exports them for backward compatibility
3. Naming conflicts were resolved by renaming conflicting types
4. All tests pass after the refactoring

## Lessons Learned

1. When refactoring types across packages, it's important to check for naming conflicts
2. Using type re-exports in the original package helps maintain backward compatibility
3. Tests are critical for verifying that the refactoring was successful
4. Some tests might need updates due to build processes or configuration changes
