# Provider Package Type Refactoring Plan (COMPLETED)

## Overview

This plan focused on extracting and reorganizing the types from the provider package into the utils package. The provider package contains types related to LLM providers, models, and provider-specific implementations that should be made available as shared types.

## Types Extracted

Based on the review of the provider package, we extracted the following types:

### Base Provider Types ✅
- Provider interface (`IProvider`)
- Provider configuration (`ProviderImplConfig`) 
- Stream types (`MessageStream`, `MessageStreamChunk`, `TextChunk`, `UsageChunk`)
- Factory types (`CreateProviderFn`)

### Error Types ✅
- Provider errors (`IProviderError`, `INetworkError`, `ITokenLimitError`, `IRateLimitError`)

### Model Types ✅
- Model ID types (`AnthropicModelId`, `OllamaModelId`, `XAIModelId`)
- Model descriptor types (`ModelDescriptor`, `GetModelFn`)

### Provider-Specific Types ✅
- Anthropic provider types (`AnthropicMessage`, `AnthropicRequestParams`)
- Ollama provider types (`OllamaRequestParams`, `OllamaResponseChunk`)
- XAI provider types (`XAIMessage`, `XAIStreamChunk`, `XAIRequestParams`)

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Base Provider Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/provider/src/base.ts`
- `packages/provider/src/types.ts`

Created type definitions in:
- `packages/utils/src/types/provider/base.ts`
- `packages/utils/src/types/provider/factory.ts`

### 2. Error Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/provider/src/errors.ts`

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/provider/errors.ts`

### 3. Model Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/provider/src/types.ts`
- Various model-specific definitions

Created type definitions in:
`packages/utils/src/types/provider/models.ts`

### 4. Provider-Specific Types

We extracted types from:
- `packages/provider/src/providers/anthropic.ts`
- `packages/provider/src/providers/ollama.ts`
- `packages/provider/src/providers/xai.ts`

Created type definitions in:
- `packages/utils/src/types/provider/anthropic.ts`
- `packages/utils/src/types/provider/ollama.ts`
- `packages/utils/src/types/provider/xai.ts`

## Integration Results

The refactoring was completed with the following outcomes:

1. All provider types are now defined in the utils package
2. The provider package imports types from utils and re-exports them for backward compatibility
3. Naming conflicts were resolved by renaming conflicting types (`ProviderConfig` → `ProviderImplConfig`)
4. Provider implementations implement the interfaces defined in utils
5. Error classes implement error interfaces defined in utils
6. Tests are passing with the new type structure

## Lessons Learned

1. When refactoring types across packages, check for naming conflicts with existing types
2. Create proper interfaces for error types to avoid breaking type checking
3. Implement proper type re-exports for backward compatibility
4. Use const assertions with string literals to fix interface compatibility issues
5. Create the logger early in constructors to avoid null reference errors in validation
