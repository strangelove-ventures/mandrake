# MCP Package Refactoring Ideas

This document outlines potential improvements and simplifications for the MCP package.

## Type System Improvements

1. **Consolidate Type Definitions**:
   - Eliminate circular dependency by moving types from utils package
   - Create proper local type definitions in the MCP package
   - Only export interfaces that are essential for consumers

## Error Handling

2. **Streamline Error Handling**:
   - Implement a dedicated `MCPError` class with error codes
   - Replace generic error handling with structured error types
   - Consolidate similar error handling patterns across classes

## Architecture Improvements

3. **Simplify Server Implementation**:
   - The `MCPServerImpl` class has many responsibilities (transport, client, and proxy management)
   - Consider splitting into smaller, focused classes
   - Extract the retry logic into a dedicated utility class

5. **Enhance Health Checks**:
   - Current implementation uses a basic polling mechanism
   - Add configurable health check strategies
   - Include more detailed health metrics beyond binary healthy/unhealthy

## Infrastructure Improvements

6. **Optimize Logging**:
   - The `LogBuffer` implementation could be improved with an optional timestamp
   - Add structured log output for better search/filtering
   - Consider moving/refactoring logging to handle rotation and cleanup

## Component Improvements

8. **Improve Proxy Implementation**:
   - Current proxy implementation has limited error recovery
   - Add reconnection capabilities to the proxy
   - Better state handling for partial failures

9. **Standardize Configuration Handling**:
   - Implement schema validation for server configurations
   - Provide default configurations for common scenarios
   - Add configuration merging/inheritance support

## Testing and Documentation

10. **Enhance Testing Support**:
    - Add built-in test utilities for integration tests
    - NO MOCKS
    - Provide helper functions for test setup/teardown

11. **Remove Unused Components**:
    - The MCPProxy is used inconsistently
    - fully implement bidirectional communication

12. **Improve Documentation**:
    - Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
    - Include usage examples in comments
    - Document common error scenarios and recovery

## Implementation Priority

High priority:
- Consolidate type definitions
- Streamline error handling
- Improve transport factory

Medium priority:
- Simplify server implementation
- Enhance health checks
- Standardize configuration handling

Low priority:
- Optimize logging
- Improve proxy implementation
- Remove unused components
