# MCP Package Refactoring Ideas

This document outlines potential improvements and simplifications for the MCP package.

## Type System Improvements

1. **Consolidate Type Definitions**: DONE
   - Eliminate circular dependency by moving types from utils package
   - Create proper local type definitions in the MCP package
   - Only export interfaces that are essential for consumers

## Error Handling

2. **Streamline Error Handling**: DONE
   - Implement a dedicated `MCPError` class with error codes
   - Replace generic error handling with structured error types
   - Consolidate similar error handling patterns across classes

## Architecture Improvements

3. **Simplify Server Implementation**: DONE
   - Split the `MCPServerImpl` class into smaller, focused classes:
     - `ServerLifecycle`: Manages server lifecycle and state
     - `TransportManager`: Handles transport creation and management
     - `ClientManager`: Manages client creation and tool operations
     - `ProxyManager`: Handles proxy setup and teardown
   - Extracted retry logic into the lifecycle component

5. **Enhance Health Checks**: DONE
   - Added ServerHealthManager component for focused health monitoring
   - Implemented configurable health check strategies (TOOL_LISTING, SPECIFIC_TOOL, PING, CUSTOM)
   - Added detailed health metrics with history tracking
   - Integrated health metrics into server state

## Infrastructure Improvements

6. **Optimize Logging**: DONE
   - Implemented an enhanced LogBuffer with timestamped entries
   - Added structured log output with level and metadata
   - Added log filtering and search capabilities
   - Improved integration with server components

## Component Improvements

9. **Standardize Configuration Handling**: DONE
   - Implement schema validation for server configurations
   - Provide default configurations for common scenarios
   - Add configuration merging/inheritance support

## Testing and Documentation

10. **Enhance Testing Support**:
    - Add built-in test utilities for integration tests
    - NO MOCKS
    - Provide helper functions for test setup/teardown

11. **Remove Unused Components**:
    - The MCPProxy is used inconsistently
    - fully implement bidirectional communication

12. **Improve Documentation**:
    - Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
    - Include usage examples in comments
    - Document common error scenarios and recovery

## Implementation Priority

High priority:
- Consolidate type definitions
- Streamline error handling
- Improve transport factory

Medium priority:
- Simplify server implementation
- Enhance health checks
- Standardize configuration handling

Low priority:
- Optimize logging
- Improve proxy implementation
- Remove unused components
