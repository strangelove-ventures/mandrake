# MCP Inspector Integration Plan (Updated)

This document outlines the updated plan for integrating the MCP Inspector code into the Mandrake MCP implementation. The goal is to enhance our implementation using principles and approaches from the MCP Inspector project.

## Current Architecture (Updated)

The Mandrake MCP implementation has been refactored to follow a modular component-based architecture:

1. **MCPManager**: Top-level service responsible for managing multiple MCP servers
2. **Server Implementation**: Modular implementation following composition pattern:
   - **MCPServerImpl**: Core server implementation that coordinates components
   - **ServerLifecycle**: Manages server lifecycle operations and state
   - **ServerHealthManager**: Dedicated health monitoring component
   - **TransportManager**: Creates and manages transport connections
   - **ClientManager**: Handles MCP client operations and tool invocation
   - **ProxyManager**: Facilitates bidirectional communication between transports
3. **Configuration System**: Schema-based validation and management:
   - **ConfigManager**: Manages validation, creation, and updating of configurations
   - **Schema Definitions**: Zod schemas for server and health check configurations
4. **Web Components**: React components for interacting with MCP servers
5. **API Client**: Connects the web UI to the backend MCP services
6. **Zustand Store**: Manages MCP state in the frontend

## Inspector Architecture

The MCP Inspector consists of:

1. **Proxy Server**: Bidirectional proxy between client and MCP servers
2. **React Hooks**: Comprehensive hooks for connection management and completions
3. **Transport Handling**: Robust implementation with better error handling and authentication
4. **Client Components**: UI components for interacting with MCP servers
