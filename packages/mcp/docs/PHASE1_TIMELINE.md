# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Update

This phase focuses on upgrading the core MCP infrastructure by implementing the proxy pattern from the Inspector code and improving error handling, connection management, and authentication support.

### 1. MCPProxy Implementation

#### Current State

The current implementation doesn't have a dedicated proxy component. Communication between client and server transports is handled directly within the `MCPServerImpl`.

#### Target State

Implement a dedicated `MCPProxy` component based on the Inspector's `mcpProxy.ts` for bidirectional communication between transports.

#### Reference Files

- **Primary Reference**: `/inspector/server/src/mcpProxy.ts` - This contains the core bidirectional proxy implementation
- **Support Reference**: `/inspector/server/src/index.ts` - Shows how the proxy is used in context

#### Implementation Steps

1. Port the core proxy functionality from the Inspector to create a new `proxy` module
2. Implement bidirectional message forwarding between transports
3. Add proper error handling and connection lifecycle management
4. Ensure clean closure of both transports when either end disconnects

### 2. Enhanced Transport Factory

#### Current State

The current transport factory has basic support for SSE and STDIO transports but lacks robust error handling and authentication support.

#### Target State

Enhance the transport factory with better error handling, authentication support for SSE, and more robust path expansion.

#### Reference Files

- **Primary Reference**: `/inspector/server/src/index.ts` (lines 25-95) - Contains the transport creation logic
- **Additional Reference**: `/inspector/client/src/lib/hooks/useConnection.ts` - Shows authentication handling for SSE

#### Implementation Steps

1. Add support for authentication in SSE connections based on the Inspector's implementation
2. Improve path handling for command arguments following the Inspector's approach
3. Enhance error handling with better diagnostics
4. Support for cross-platform command execution

### 3. Enhanced Server Implementation

#### Current State

The current server implementation has basic lifecycle management and error handling.

#### Target State

Enhance the server implementation with better lifecycle management, more robust error handling, support for stderr capture, and improved logging.

#### Reference Files

- **Primary Reference**: `/inspector/server/src/index.ts` (lines 96-175) - Server handling in the Inspector
- **Additional Reference**: `/inspector/client/src/lib/hooks/useConnection.ts` - Error handling and connection management

#### Implementation Steps

1. Implement better state tracking for server status
2. Add robust error handling with proper error categorization
3. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Enhance logging for better diagnostics
5. Add proper cleanup on server shutdown

### 4. Manager Enhancements

#### Current State

The current MCP Manager handles basic server lifecycle operations.

#### Target State

Enhance the manager with better server status tracking, improved error handling, and server health checks.

#### Reference Files

- **Primary Reference**: The Inspector doesn't have a direct equivalent to our manager, but we can apply patterns from `/inspector/server/src/index.ts` and `/inspector/client/src/lib/hooks/useConnection.ts`

#### Implementation Steps

1. Implement server health check mechanism using real connections to test servers
2. Add better status tracking for all servers
3. Improve server lifecycle management
4. Add support for restarting failed servers
5. Enhance error propagation and handling

### 5. Integration Testing

#### Current State

Limited testing for MCP implementation.

#### Target State

Comprehensive integration testing against real MCP servers.

#### Reference Files

- **Inspiration**: `/inspector/client/src/lib/hooks/useConnection.ts` (error handling patterns)

#### Implementation Steps

1. Set up integration test environments with actual MCP servers (ripper, function-server, etc.)
2. Implement end-to-end tests for the full connection lifecycle
3. Test error handling by introducing various failure modes in real servers
4. Test the completions functionality with servers that support it
5. Implement performance tests with real connections

### 6. SDK Adapter Layer

#### Current State

Direct dependencies on MCP SDK which can lead to versioning issues.

#### Target State

Create adapter interfaces to decouple our code from direct SDK dependencies while maintaining full compatibility with real implementations.

#### Implementation Steps

1. Create adapter interfaces that match the actual SDK interfaces
2. Use these adapters throughout the codebase to reduce direct SDK dependencies
3. Ensure all adapters are tested against real SDK implementations

This implementation plan focuses on integration with real implementations rather than mocks, and provides specific references to the Inspector code to make implementation easier. All testing will be done against actual MCP servers to ensure real-world compatibility and robustness.
