# MCP Server Management in Mandrake

## Summary

We looked at both official and third-party MCP servers to understand how to best integrate and manage them in Mandrake. The key findings are:

1. MCP servers come in many forms:
   - Official Node.js servers (filesystem, github, etc)
   - Official Python servers (fetch, git)  
   - Third-party implementations in various languages
   - Some with Docker containers, some without

2. Server requirements vary greatly:
   - API-based servers need tokens/credentials
   - System tools need host access (Docker, Kubernetes)
   - Storage-based servers need persistence
   - Some need special host system access/binaries

3. Current implementations like Claude Desktop use a simple JSON config that runs servers directly with package managers (`npx`, `uvx`). This works but has limitations around:
   - Package management
   - Persistence
   - System access
   - Resource isolation

4. Docker emerges as a good solution because it provides:
   - Consistent environment
   - Resource isolation
   - Volume management for persistence
   - Network control
   - Health monitoring
   - Process supervision

## Proposed Approach

Build a Docker-based server management system that can:

1. Start servers in isolated containers
2. Handle volume mounting for persistence/configs
3. Manage environment variables securely
4. Monitor health and restart failed servers
5. Provide proper cleanup on shutdown

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle servers that need direct host access (Docker, K8s)?
2. What's the best way to manage secrets/credentials?
3. How do we handle servers without Docker images?
4. What's the right persistence strategy for stateful servers?
5. How do we test server stability/recovery?

## Research Needed

1. Explore Docker-in-Docker patterns for system access servers
2. Look at secret management solutions (Vault, etc)
3. Investigate health check patterns for MCP servers
4. Research container networking for inter-server communication
5. Study volume management best practices

## Testing Plan

1. Development Environment
   - Set up test cluster with Docker Compose
   - Include mix of server types:
     - API server (GitHub)
     - System server (Docker)
     - Storage server (Memory)
     - Custom server

2. Test Scenarios
   - Server startup/shutdown
   - Credential management
   - Volume persistence
   - Network isolation
   - Health monitoring
   - Error recovery

3. Integration Testing
   - Server interaction through LangChain
   - Multi-server workflows
   - Resource cleanup
   - Load testing

4. Validation Approach
   - Unit tests for manager logic
   - Integration tests with Docker
   - End-to-end tests with real servers
   - Performance benchmarking
